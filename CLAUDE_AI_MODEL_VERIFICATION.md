## Verification Evidence

### âœ… Live Scheduled Job Execution

```
**From Database Evidence:**

### âœ… Technical Fix Validation
**Code Fix Applied:**
```javascript
// FIXED LOGIC - prioritize direct aiModel field from scheduled jobs
const selectedAiModel = data.aiModel || (data.aiModels && data.aiModels.length > 0 ? data.aiModels[0] : 'claude');
```

**Priority Logic:**
1. `data.aiModel` (from scheduled job configuration) - **HIGHEST PRIORITY**
2. `data.aiModels[0]` (from array fallback) - Secondary
