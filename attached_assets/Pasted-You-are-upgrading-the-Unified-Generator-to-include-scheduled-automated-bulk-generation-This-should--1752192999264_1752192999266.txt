You are upgrading the Unified Generator to include scheduled automated bulk generation. This should be a seamless, fully integrated feature for users who want content generated on a regular, automated schedule.

# 🧠 PRIMARY OBJECTIVE
Implement a scheduling system that allows users to configure, manage, and execute fully automated bulk content generation jobs at a specific time each day.

---

# ✅ FEATURE 1: "Schedule Daily Bulk Generation" Toggle

- Add a new toggle under the **Advanced Options** section in the Unified Generator labeled:
  `Schedule Daily Bulk Generation`
  > "Run this bulk generation automatically each day at the selected time"

- When toggled ON, a new **dropdown panel should expand** (just like the existing 'Spartan Format' logic) with the following settings:

---

## ⏰ Dropdown Scheduler Settings:

- **Time Selector**: Allow the user to select hour + minute (e.g., 5:00 AM)
- **Timezone Detection**: Auto-detect the user's timezone (or allow manual override if needed)
- **Confirmation Message**: Display a summary like:
  > "This bulk generation will auto-run every day at 5:00 AM ET"

- **Pre-Selected Options to Apply at Run Time**:
  - All selected niches
  - All selected tones
  - Selected content templates
  - Selected target platforms
  - Spartan Format toggle state
  - Webhook URL (if present)

---

# ✅ FEATURE 2: Sidebar "Schedule Manager" Section

- Add a new item in the left sidebar:  
  📆 `Schedule Manager`

- Clicking this should open a new view showing:
  - A list of all active scheduled bulk generation jobs
  - For each scheduled job:
    - Time of execution
    - Niches included
    - Content templates used
    - Target platforms selected
    - Spartan mode status
    - Webhook URL (if configured)
    - An ON/OFF toggle or pause button
    - A "Run Now" button to manually trigger early
    - A delete (trash) icon to remove the job

---

# ⚙️ FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS

- Scheduled jobs must run in the background at the assigned time daily
- Generated content should behave exactly as if the user had pressed "Start Bulk Generation"
- Generated content must be saved into content history and integrated with any existing webhook flows
- All automation must respect Spartan Format rules if enabled

---

# 🚨 VALIDATION & TESTING REQUIRED

Please test:
- Creating new scheduled jobs with various configurations
- Ensuring the correct options persist and are applied on schedule
- Confirm timezones and selected times trigger content creation accurately
- Run Now and Delete functions work
- Sidebar reflects current job status and logs recent executions

---

# USER EXPERIENCE DETAILS

- Everything should feel native to the existing Bulk Generator layout
- The new schedule panel should **only appear** if the toggle is on
- No impact to non-scheduled manual generations
- Add a success toast after saving a schedule:  
  > "✅ Scheduled! Your daily bulk generation will run at 5:00 AM."

Make sure the entire system feels seamless and empowers the user to automate their content generation workflow across all selected niches and platforms without manual intervention.
