I want to replace the "Skincare" niche in my app with "Beauty and Personal Care" and ensure everything updates accordingly.

Please update the following:

---

🔁 1. **Perplexity Trending Prompt Logic**
- In any file that fetches trending products (e.g. `perplexityFetchSkincare.ts`):
  - Rename the file to: `perplexityFetchBeauty.ts`
  - Update prompt text:
    - From: “skincare products”
    - To: “beauty and personal care products”
  - Adjust the product categories in the prompt:
    - From: “serums, cleansers, moisturizers”
    - To: “makeup, skincare, haircare, personal care items”

Example updated prompt:
You are a product research API. Return 3 trending beauty and personal care products from Amazon that are viral on TikTok or Instagram as of [month year].

Requirements:

Real products only (makeup, skincare, haircare, grooming, etc.)

Specific brand names (e.g. The Ordinary, Fenty Beauty, OUAI, Native)

Mentions: 50,000–2,000,000

Unique trending reason (max 8 words)

Respond in JSON only:
[
{
"product": "...",
"brand": "...",
"mentions": 1230000,
"reason": "..."
},
...
]

🧠 2. **ChatGPT Content Generation Prompts**
- In your `promptFactory()` or wherever prompts are constructed per niche:
  - Rename "Skincare" references to "Beauty and Personal Care"
  - Ensure the tone and examples match the wider category (e.g., include haircare, cosmetics, grooming)

🧩 3. **Frontend & Dropdowns**
- Update all user-facing dropdowns, buttons, tabs, and labels:
  - Replace `Skincare` with `Beauty and Personal Care`
  - This includes the niche selector and any tags shown on trending cards

📦 4. **File + Function Renames**
- Rename or refactor:
  - `perplexityFetchSkincare.ts` → `perplexityFetchBeauty.ts`
  - `fetchTrendingSkincareProducts()` → `fetchTrendingBeautyProducts()`
  - Any variable names like `skincareTrending` → `beautyTrending`

✅ Final Result:
- All logic and prompts now focus on the broader "Beauty and Personal Care" niche
- Perplexity returns more diverse, niche-relevant products
- ChatGPT creates content tailored to the broader beauty space
