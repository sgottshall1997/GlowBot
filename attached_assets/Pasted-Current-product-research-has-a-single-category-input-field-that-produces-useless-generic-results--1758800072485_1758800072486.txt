Current product research has a single "category" input field that produces 
useless generic results. Replace it with a multi-field form that captures 
real constraints and forces specific, actionable research.

REMOVE CURRENT INPUT:
- Single text field "Product Category"

BUILD NEW INPUT FORM with these fields:

1. PROBLEM/PAIN POINT (required, textarea)
   Label: "What specific problem are you solving?"
   Placeholder: "Women spending $100+ on salon nails every 2 weeks"
   Helper text: "Be specific. 'Beauty' is not a problem. 'Expensive salon 
   visits' is a problem."

2. TARGET CUSTOMER (required, text)
   Label: "Who specifically has this problem?"
   Placeholder: "Working professionals 25-40 in NYC/LA/Miami"
   Helper text: "Not 'everyone' - who feels this pain most acutely?"

3. MAXIMUM PRODUCT COST (required, number)
   Label: "Maximum manufacturing cost per unit you can afford"
   Placeholder: "$10"
   Helper text: "What's realistic for your budget to produce at scale?"

4. TARGET RETAIL PRICE (required, number)
   Label: "What price point can your customer afford?"
   Placeholder: "$35"
   Helper text: "What would they actually pay without hesitation?"

5. VALIDATION BUDGET (required, dropdown)
   Label: "How much can you spend testing demand?"
   Options: 
   - "$200-300 (minimal test)"
   - "$500-800 (standard validation)" 
   - "$1000-1500 (thorough test)"

6. CONTENT CAPABILITY (required, checkbox)
   Label: "What content can you realistically create?"
   Options:
   - [ ] Professional product photography
   - [ ] Simple product videos (phone)
   - [ ] Demonstration/tutorial videos
   - [ ] User testimonial content
   - [ ] Text/graphics only
   Helper text: "Be honest - what can you actually produce?"

7. TIMELINE (required, dropdown)
   Label: "When do you want to launch?"
   Options:
   - "4-6 weeks (fast test)"
   - "2-3 months (standard)"
   - "6+ months (research phase)"

8. OPTIONAL: Competitor Reference (text)
   Label: "Any successful brand doing something similar?"
   Placeholder: "Tyler Glamorous Wash, Dedcool, etc."
   Helper text: "Leave blank if exploring new territory"

UPDATE API LOGIC:

Modify /server/api/product-research.ts to build Perplexity query from these 
inputs:

"Find 3 specific product opportunities that match these exact constraints:
- Solves problem: [problem field]
- Target customer: [target customer field]  
- Manufacturing cost under: [max cost field]
- Can sell for: [target price field]
- Testable with: [validation budget field]
- Content creation capability: [selected options]

For each opportunity provide specific product, demand proof, competition 
analysis, margin calculation, and go/no-go recommendation. Only suggest 
products that fit ALL these constraints."

UPDATE VALIDATION:

- All required fields must be filled
- Manufacturing cost must be at least 50% below retail price (otherwise 
  margins impossible)
- Show error if retail price is under $15 (impulse buy threshold) or over 
  $100 (requires long consideration)
- Warn if validation budget is under $500 ("Results may be inconclusive")

UPDATE UI:

- Replace single input with multi-field form
- Add "Why these questions?" expandable section explaining the reasoning
- Show constraint summary before search: "Searching for products under $10 
  cost that solve [problem] for [customer] at $35 price point"
- Add "Save Search Criteria" to reuse constraints for future searches

The goal: Force the user to think through their actual constraints BEFORE 
searching, so research returns only executable opportunities, not fantasy 
products they can't afford to test or manufacture.

No more "beauty" returning luxury fragrances that cost $50k to formulate.
