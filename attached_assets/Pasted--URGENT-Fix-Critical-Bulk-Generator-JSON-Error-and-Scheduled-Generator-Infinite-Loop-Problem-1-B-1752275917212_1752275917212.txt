URGENT: Fix Critical Bulk Generator JSON Error and Scheduled Generator Infinite Loop

Problem 1 - Bulk Generator JSON Error:
The automated bulk generator is returning HTML instead of JSON, causing "Unexpected token '<', "<!DOCTYPE" error. This suggests the API endpoint is crashing and returning an error page.

Problem 2 - Scheduled Generator Infinite Loop:
The scheduled generator is still creating infinite loops with corrupted output, indicating the cron job fixes haven't fully resolved the issue.

Required Fixes:

Fix JSON Response Error in Automated Bulk Generator:

Debug and fix the /api/automated-bulk/start endpoint in server/api/automated-bulk-generation.ts
Add proper error handling to prevent HTML error pages from being returned
Ensure all responses are valid JSON format
Fix any undefined/null property access that might be causing crashes
Add request validation to catch malformed data before processing
Complete Scheduled Generator Infinite Loop Prevention:

Enhance the cron job lifecycle management in server/api/scheduled-bulk-generation.ts
Add emergency circuit breaker to stop runaway processes
Implement proper task cleanup with task.stop() and task.destroy()
Add maximum execution time limits per cron job
Create process-level termination for zombie cron jobs
Add Comprehensive Error Handling:

Wrap all API endpoints in try-catch blocks with proper JSON error responses
Add input validation for all bulk generation requests
Implement graceful degradation when services fail
Add detailed logging for debugging future issues
Create Emergency Stop Functionality:

Add /api/emergency-stop-all endpoint to immediately halt all generation
Implement server-level safeguards to prevent runaway processes
Add monitoring to detect infinite loops automatically
Fix Frontend Error Handling:

Update AutomatedBulkGenerator.tsx to handle API errors gracefully
Add retry logic with exponential backoff
Provide clear error messages to users instead of raw JSON parse errors
Test Requirements:

Verify bulk generator returns valid JSON responses under all conditions
Test that scheduled jobs properly start, run once, and terminate
Confirm emergency stop functionality works immediately
Validate error messages are user-friendly, not technical stack traces
Priority: CRITICAL - System stability issue preventing core functionality

The goal is to ensure both the manual bulk generator and scheduled generator work reliably without crashes, infinite loops, or corrupted output.
