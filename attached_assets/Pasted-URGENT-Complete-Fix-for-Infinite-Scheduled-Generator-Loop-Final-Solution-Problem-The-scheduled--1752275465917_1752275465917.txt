URGENT: Complete Fix for Infinite Scheduled Generator Loop - Final Solution

Problem: The scheduled bulk automation continues running non-stop after being triggered, creating multiple duplicate cron jobs that execute simultaneously and never properly terminate.

Root Causes Identified:

activeCronJobs.clear() in initialization doesn't properly destroy existing tasks
Multiple cron jobs can exist for the same scheduled job ID without proper cleanup
No emergency stop mechanism for runaway cron processes
Cron jobs aren't properly scoped to prevent overlap
Server restart can initialize duplicate jobs on top of existing ones
Required Comprehensive Fixes:

Fix initializeScheduledJobs() in server/api/scheduled-bulk-generation.ts:

Add task.stop() and task.destroy() before activeCronJobs.clear()
Implement proper cleanup loop with error handling
Add startup delay to ensure clean initialization
Enhance startCronJob() function:

Add unique cron job identifiers with timestamps
Implement job overlap prevention (check if job is already running)
Add automatic job termination after single execution for bulk jobs
Include comprehensive logging for debugging
Fix updateScheduledJob() and deleteScheduledJob():

Ensure task.stop() AND task.destroy() are always called
Add validation that old job is completely destroyed before creating new one
Implement retry mechanism for stubborn cron jobs
Add Emergency Stop All Functionality:

Create emergencyStopAllCronJobs() function that forcibly terminates ALL active cron jobs
Add API endpoint /api/scheduled-bulk-generation/emergency-stop
Implement process-level termination for zombie cron jobs
Implement Cron Job Monitoring:

Add getActiveCronJobsCount() function
Create /api/scheduled-bulk-generation/status endpoint to show active jobs
Add automatic cleanup for jobs running longer than expected duration
Add Safeguards Against Runaway Jobs:

Implement maximum execution time limit per cron job (e.g., 10 minutes)
Add automatic job termination after completion
Prevent multiple jobs from running for the same scheduled job ID simultaneously
Fix Server Startup Sequence:

Clear all existing cron jobs completely before starting new ones
Add startup validation that no duplicate jobs exist
Implement graceful shutdown handler to clean up cron jobs on server stop
Expected Outcome:

Only ONE cron job should exist per scheduled job entry
Cron jobs should automatically terminate after successful execution
Emergency stop should immediately halt all scheduled generation
Server restart should not create duplicate cron jobs
Complete elimination of infinite loop behavior
Test Requirements:

Verify only one active cron job exists after scheduling
Test emergency stop functionality works immediately
Confirm server restart doesn't duplicate existing jobs
Validate that completed jobs properly clean themselves up
Test that updating/deleting jobs completely removes old cron tasks
Priority: CRITICAL - This affects system stability and resource usage

Please implement these fixes with comprehensive error handling, detailed logging, and thorough testing to ensure the scheduled generator works reliably without runaway processes.
