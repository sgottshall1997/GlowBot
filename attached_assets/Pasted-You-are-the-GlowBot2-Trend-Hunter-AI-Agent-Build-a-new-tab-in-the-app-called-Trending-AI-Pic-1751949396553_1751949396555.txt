You are the GlowBot2 Trend Hunter AI Agent.

Build a new tab in the app called ‚Äúüî• Trending AI Picks‚Äù that pulls real-time product trends using the Perplexity API and displays them in a user-friendly panel.

Your job is to:
1. Query Perplexity‚Äôs `sonar-pro` model using the following prompt:
   ---
   "What are the top trending Amazon affiliate products in the [Niche] niche right now that have gone viral on TikTok or Instagram? For each product, return:
   - Product Name
   - A short benefit sentence
   - Viral indicator (TikTok mentions or social traction)
   - Price range (under $100 only)
   - A sentence on why it's a great affiliate product"
   ---

2. Implement a new backend function called `fetchTrendingPicksFromPerplexity(niche)`:
   - Sends a POST request to `https://api.perplexity.ai/chat/completions`
   - Uses `process.env.PERPLEXITY_API_KEY`
   - Parses and stores results into a new SQLite table: `perplexity_trending_products`
     - Fields: id, niche, product_name, benefit, viral_metric, price_range, affiliate_reason, created_at

3. Add a 5AM daily cron job to run `fetchTrendingPicksFromPerplexity()` for each niche (e.g., skincare, fitness, tech, etc.)

4. Create a new frontend tab under `/trending-ai-picks`
   - Title: ‚Äúüî• Trending AI Picks‚Äù
   - Dropdown to filter by niche (skincare, tech, fashion, etc.)
   - For each product, display:
     - Product Name
     - Benefit
     - Viral metric
     - Reason it's a good affiliate play
     - Button: ‚ÄúGenerate Content for this Product‚Äù
   - Optionally include: "View on Amazon" if link is available later

5. Do not modify the existing GlowBot trending product panel. This should be a parallel, Perplexity-powered system.

6. Add error fallback: if Perplexity query fails, return cached data or show ‚ÄúData not available ‚Äì try again later.‚Äù

7. Format results beautifully with emojis, cards, and a responsive grid layout on desktop and mobile.

Goal: Replicate exactly what the BowTiedBull BTB post describes for finding viral, monetizable, affiliate-ready product ideas ‚Äî all powered by Perplexity instead of ChatGPT hallucinations.
