🔥 Let’s do it, Spence. Here’s how we’ll add a **“Generate Ad Script”** button inside your GlowBot2 app that outputs a polished, Pictory-ready video script to promote **CookAIng** — like something a pro DTC brand would run.

---

### ✅ Button Functionality Overview

When clicked:

* Triggers GPT with a **pre-polished prompt** for a CookAIng video ad
* GPT returns a 45–60 second **script**, structured into:

  * Hook
  * Problem
  * Solution (CookAIng)
  * Features / Demo Line
  * CTA (with affiliate tag or download link)
* Output is auto-copied or saved as a Google Doc
* Ready for Pictory input

### 💻 REPLIT FRONTEND BUTTON COMPONENT (Vite + TSX + Tailwind)

Add this where your platform-specific content buttons live:

```tsx
<button
  className="bg-gradient-to-r from-orange-400 to-red-500 text-white px-4 py-2 rounded-2xl text-lg font-semibold shadow hover:scale-105 transition"
  onClick={handleGenerateCookAIngAd}
>
  🎬 Generate CookAIng Ad Script
</button>
```

### 🧠 GPT PROMPT (put this in your backend under `promptFactory()`)

```ts
if (templateType === 'cookaingAdScript') {
  return `
You are a world-class direct-response ad copywriter and video script strategist working for a viral food-tech startup.

Write a polished, Pictory-ready video ad script (under 60 seconds) promoting **CookAIng**, an AI-powered cooking assistant app that generates custom recipes based on ingredients, dietary needs, and cooking methods.

Structure:
- 🎯 **Hook (1–2 lines)** — Grab attention FAST
- 😫 **Problem (2–3 lines)** — Common frustration with cooking
- 💡 **Solution (2–3 lines)** — Introduce CookAIng as the fix
- 🍳 **Demo Line (1–2 lines)** — What does the user *see*? What’s the “wow” moment?
- ✅ **Features (3–4 bullets)** — What makes it great?
- 📲 **Call to Action** — Get people to download the app

Tone: Friendly, modern, trustworthy. Think: **Tasty meets Headspace**.

Format it in clear sections with bold titles (e.g., **Hook:**).

Avoid fluff — make it conversion-focused.

```
