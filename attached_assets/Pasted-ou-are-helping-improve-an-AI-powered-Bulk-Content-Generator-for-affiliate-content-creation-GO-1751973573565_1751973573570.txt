ou are helping improve an AI-powered Bulk Content Generator for affiliate content creation.

🔁 GOAL:
When a user presses “Start Bulk Generation,” automatically generate viral content across niches using these exact steps, with full backend automation support.

🧩 REQUIRED STEPS FOR EACH NICHE:

1. **Auto-Select Trending Product per Niche**
   - Pull 1 trending product for each niche: Beauty, Fitness, Tech, Fashion, Travel, Cooking, Pets.
   - Use Perplexity (or similar source) to find a *real trending product*, not a generic example.

2. **Auto-Fill Fields**  
   - Pre-fill “Product Name” and “Niche”
   - Add an editable optional input box: “Amazon Affiliate Link”

3. **Content Generation Workflow (per product):**
   - Run Perplexity product-specific query:  
     ➤ “What’s going viral about [product name] on Instagram, TikTok, YouTube Shorts?”
   - Extract 2–3 content inspiration points (headlines, angles, formats, etc.)
   - Feed the product name and inspiration into ChatGPT to generate:
     - A product description
     - Viral hook
     - 1 short-form video script (Template: Short-Form Script)
     - 1 review-style caption for TikTok, Instagram, YouTube, Twitter
     - Hashtags + CTA + affiliate link appended automatically

4. **Content Generation Settings (reused from UI)**
   - Tones: Use selected user tones (e.g., Friendly + Enthusiastic)
   - Templates: Must include:
     ✔ Product Review  
     ✔ Viral Hook  
     ✔ Short-Form Video Script  
   - Target Platforms:
     ✔ TikTok  
     ✔ Instagram  
     ✔ YouTube  
     ✔ Twitter

5. **Save to History**
   - Log each content piece by:
     - Product Name
     - Niche
     - Platform
     - Templates used
     - Dropdown view: reveals all generated outputs
     - Include the timestamp + affiliate link
