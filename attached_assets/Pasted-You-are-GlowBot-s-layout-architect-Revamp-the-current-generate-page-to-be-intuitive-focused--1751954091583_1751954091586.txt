🧼 CLEANUP INSTRUCTIONS:

1. 🧭 Move "Browse Trending Products" above the fold
   - Show all 7 niche tabs at top
   - Auto-display 3 trending products per niche (from Perplexity API only)
   - Add “Use Product” button on each card that sets `product`, `niche`, and `url` in local state

2. 🧠 Reorganize all inputs below into one simple content generation module
   Move this entire section into a **2-column card** layout:
   - 📄 **Left column:**
     - Product name (pre-filled if selected above)
     - Niche (pre-filled too, but editable)
     - Affiliate Link Generator:
       - Select Affiliate Network (Amazon, ShareASale, etc.)
       - Input Affiliate ID
       - Input Product URL
       - ✅ Auto-create smart redirect URL

   - 🚀 **Right column:**
     - Platform Selector (TikTok, Instagram, etc.) with toggle pills
     - Schedule dropdown (Post Now, Schedule Later)
     - Template Type dropdown
     - Tone dropdown
     - CTA: ⚡️ Generate Content

3. 🔗 OPTIONAL HOOK GENERATOR SECTION
   Move "Viral Hook Generator" into a collapsible panel
   Default: collapsed
   Only open if user wants to test alternate hooks

4. 🎨 Design polish
   - Give every major section a soft shadow and title
   - Use color-coded platform badges (like your TikTok/Instagram blocks)
   - Group related actions in same card (don’t scatter them)

5. 🔁 Output
   - On “Generate Content,” render the content card below with options to:
     - Copy individual sections
     - View/edit hook
     - Regenerate with same inputs
