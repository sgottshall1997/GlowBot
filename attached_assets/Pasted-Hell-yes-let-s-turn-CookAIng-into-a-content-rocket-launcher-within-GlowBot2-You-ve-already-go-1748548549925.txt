Hell yes — let’s turn CookAIng into a **content rocket launcher** within GlowBot2. You’ve already got the infrastructure to pull this off — now we’re just going to wire it into the rest of the GlowBot ecosystem and Make.com.

### ✅ Here’s What We’re Building

A **daily content pipeline** that:

1. **Selects a trending ingredient at 5AM**
2. **Generates 3–5 cooking method recipes**
3. **Feeds each into GlowBot2’s content engine**
4. **Creates platform-ready posts**
5. **Schedules and distributes them automatically**
6. **Tracks performance data to improve over time**

## 🛠️ REPLIT AGENT PROMPT — CookAIng Daily Content Pipeline

Paste this into your Replit GPT Agent:

````ts
You are acting as a senior full-stack AI automation architect.

Your goal is to integrate the CookAIng recipe generator app into GlowBot2’s multi-niche content engine.

Build a pipeline that:

1. **At 5AM daily**, picks a “Trending Ingredient of the Day” (use cached trending data or a GPT-generated suggestion).
2. Uses the ingredient to generate **3–5 recipes** across different cooking methods (e.g., air fryer, oven, grill, sous vide, etc.).
3. For each recipe, build a structured JSON payload like:

```json
{
  "niche": "cooking",
  "productName": "Chicken Breast",
  "contentType": "recipePost",
  "script": "Learn how to make juicy air fryer chicken breast in 20 mins…",
  "caption": "🔥 Air Fryer Chicken = Dinner Hero. #EasyDinner #AirFryerGoals",
  "hashtags": "#airfryer #chickenrecipe #quickmeals",
  "cta": "🍗 Get the top-rated air fryer here 👉 [affiliate link]",
  "platforms": ["TikTok", "Instagram", "Pinterest"],
  "videoDuration": "45s",
  "imagePrompt": "A crispy air fryer chicken breast on a white plate with garnish",
  "cookingMethod": "air fryer",
  "postType": "video"
}
````

4. Send all recipe payloads via `POST` webhook to Make.com (use `{{WEBHOOK_URL}}` placeholder).
5. Store a copy in local SQLite with:

   * ingredient
   * method
   * recipe name
   * timestamp
   * json blob
6. Trigger downstream automation to:

   * Add script to Google Docs (for Pictory)
   * Update Google Sheet tracker
   * Schedule post for each platform
   * Track link clicks and impressions later

Also:

* Only run this daily at 5AM.
* Cache trending ingredient and recipe generation to avoid re-fetching or duplicating.
* Label all output with `source: CookAIng`.

Make it modular so future niche apps (e.g., travel, fitness) can follow the same format.

```

## 🔗 Make.com Modules to Connect

Here’s what your Make.com scenario should include:

1. **Webhook trigger** (from Replit or backend scheduler)
2. **Router** (loop through each recipe payload)
3. **Create Google Doc** (from `script`)
4. **Update Google Sheet** (store metadata + tracking info)
5. **Send to Pictory** (for video generation)
6. **Auto-schedule post** (based on platform logic)
7. **Insert affiliate link redirect logic** (trackable URLs)
8. *(Optional)*: Add to a MongoDB or Firebase log for long-term AI learning

## 🚀 Bonus UX Idea for the App

Inside CookAIng:

- Add a section: “🔥 Ingredient of the Day”  
  → Let users generate their own content for that ingredient  
  → Include a **Share This Recipe** button that sends the JSON payload directly into your posting pipeline

This turns **users into content engines** and creates a flywheel with zero effort.

Want me to give you:
- The exact `cron` scheduler code for Replit?
- The JSON schema for Make.com and Google Sheet?
- The Google Doc format template?

Just say the word. You're about 3 integrations away from **BTB-level full automation**.
