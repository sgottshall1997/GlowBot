Despite the recent safeguard system updates, content is still being generated automatically even when I haven’t triggered it. This must be fully fixed.

🚫 I want to **completely block any content generation** unless it comes from:
- ✅ A manual generation trigger through the UI
- ✅ A legitimate scheduled generation run (that I explicitly initiate or configure)

⚠️ At the same time, please ensure the **Perplexity trend fetcher remains active at 5:00 AM**, but only fetches trend data — it should not create any content.

🔍 ACTION PLAN:

1. 🔎 **Trace and Kill All Unauthorized Generation Triggers**
   - Review the entire codebase for any remaining:
     - Cron jobs
     - Background workers
     - Queue consumers
     - Retry logic
     - Make/Zapier webhooks
     - Trend-based triggers
     - Legacy scheduled tasks
   - Identify and permanently disable any logic that initiates `generateContent()` or similar calls without:
     - Manual trigger from the dashboard
     - Approved, scheduled execution window

2. 🛡️ **Reinforce Generation Safeguards**
   - Strengthen `generation-safeguards.ts` and apply it at the top of **every generation entry point**
   - Block all generation unless it explicitly matches one of these conditions:
     ```ts
     if (!isManualUITrigger && !isApprovedScheduler) {
       log("❌ Blocked unauthorized generation");
       return null;
     }
     ```

3. ⚙️ **Implement a Global Gatekeeper Flag**
   - Add:
     ```ts
     const GENERATION_ALLOWED = isManualUITrigger || isApprovedScheduler;
     ```
   - Log the origin of each request so we can trace:
     - Source: manual, scheduler, webhook, unknown
     - Model, niche, product, timestamp

4. 📈 **KEEP Perplexity Trend Fetcher ON**
   - The 5:00 AM trend-fetch job should continue running
   - Confirm:
     - It **only fetches and stores** trending product data
     - It never calls `generateContent()` or triggers any webhook
   - Isolate it with a flag like `ALLOW_TREND_FETCH = true`

5. 🧪 **Run 2-Hour Watchdog Test**
   - Enable full logging of all generation attempts and their sources
   - During the window, simulate:
     - Manual generation (✅ should succeed)
     - Scheduled generation (✅ should succeed)
     - Any other automatic trigger (❌ should be blocked + logged)

6. ✅ **Final Output**
   - Identify exactly what was still triggering content creation
   - Show which code/config was removed or modified
   - Confirm:
     - ✅ Only manual UI and scheduler-triggered generation is allowed
     - ✅ All rogue processes are terminated
     - ✅ Trend fetcher is fully isolated from generation
     - ✅ Logs confirm no unauthorized content generation occurred during the test window

This is critical for full stability and control of the content generation system. Please prioritize and confirm once locked down.
