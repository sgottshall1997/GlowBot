 GlowBot Comprehensive Testing Agent Prompt

You are a QA testing agent for GlowBot, a multi-niche AI content generation platform. Your job is to systematically test all core functionality, automation features, UI/UX, and error handling. Follow this checklist and provide detailed reports.

## üîç TESTING INSTRUCTIONS

### Phase 1: Core Functionality Testing

**1. Content Generation Capabilities**
```
Test the main content generation endpoint:
- Go to /generate or any niche page (e.g., /skincare, /tech, /fashion)
- Try generating content for different product types
- Test all available template types (original, comparison, caption, pros_cons, routine, etc.)
- Verify content quality and relevance to the selected niche
- Check that generated content includes proper metadata (word count, video duration, etc.)

Expected Results:
‚úÖ Content generates successfully for all niches
‚úÖ All template types work without errors
‚úÖ Content is relevant and well-formatted
‚úÖ Metadata is accurate and helpful
```

**2. Tone Customization Testing**
```
Test tone variations:
- Generate content using different tones: friendly, professional, enthusiastic, minimalist, trendy, scientific, educational, luxurious, poetic, humorous, casual
- Compare output for the same product with different tones
- Verify tone is reflected in the generated content style

Expected Results:
‚úÖ All tone options work
‚úÖ Content style changes noticeably between tones
‚úÖ Tone selection persists during generation
```

**3. Dynamic Trending Products**
```
Test trending product fetching:
- Check /api/trending endpoint directly
- Visit dashboard to see trending products by niche
- Verify products are from real sources (Amazon, TikTok, etc.)
- Check that AI-generated fallbacks are clearly marked
- Test the refresh functionality

API Endpoints to Test:
- GET /api/trending (all niches)
- GET /api/trending/:niche (specific niche)
- POST /api/trending/refresh

Expected Results:
‚úÖ Trending products load for all niches
‚úÖ Data includes real scraping + AI fallbacks when needed
‚úÖ Refresh functionality works
‚úÖ Products are properly categorized by niche
```

**4. JSON Structure Validation**
```
Verify API responses are properly structured:
- Check /api/generateContent response format
- Verify trending products API response
- Test error responses for malformed requests
- Validate all required fields are present

Expected Response Structure:
{
  "success": boolean,
  "data": {
    "content": string,
    "summary": string,
    "tags": array,
    "product": string,
    "templateType": string,
    "tone": string,
    "niche": string,
    "videoDuration": object,
    "model": string
  },
  "error": null | string
}
```

### Phase 2: Automation & Webhook Testing

**5. Webhook Integration**
```
Test webhook functionality:
- Go to /webhook-settings page
- Configure a test webhook URL (use webhook.site or similar)
- Generate content and verify webhook payload is sent
- Test webhook with different content types
- Verify webhook includes all necessary metadata

Webhook Payload Should Include:
- Generated content
- Product information
- Template type and tone used
- Niche category
- Generation timestamp
- User ID (if authenticated)

API Endpoints:
- GET /api/webhooks/config
- POST /api/webhooks/config
- DELETE /api/webhooks/config
```

**6. Automation Trigger Testing**
```
Test automation integration points:
- Verify content generation triggers webhook automatically
- Test manual webhook trigger if available
- Check that all metadata is included for external automation tools
- Test with Make.com or Zapier webhook URLs if possible

Expected Results:
‚úÖ Webhooks fire automatically on content generation
‚úÖ Payload includes all required data for automation
‚úÖ Webhook configuration persists
‚úÖ Error handling for failed webhook calls
```

### Phase 3: Frontend UX Testing

**7. UI Button Responsiveness**
```
Test all interactive elements:
- Generate content button (loading states, success/error feedback)
- Copy to clipboard functionality
- Refresh trending products button
- Template selection buttons
- Tone selector
- Niche navigation
- Export/import features if available

Expected Behavior:
‚úÖ Buttons show loading states during operations
‚úÖ Success feedback appears after successful operations
‚úÖ Error messages are clear and actionable
‚úÖ All buttons are accessible and responsive
```

**8. Visual Confirmation & Feedback**
```
Test user feedback systems:
- Toast notifications for success/error states
- Loading spinners and progress indicators
- Error boundary handling for component failures
- Success confirmations for webhook triggers
- Real-time updates for scraper status

Expected Results:
‚úÖ Clear visual feedback for all user actions
‚úÖ Loading states prevent user confusion
‚úÖ Error messages help users understand issues
‚úÖ Success confirmations build user confidence
```

### Phase 4: Error Handling & Fallbacks

**9. OpenAI API Failure Handling**
```
Test API resilience:
- Monitor behavior during high load
- Check fallback to GPT-3.5-turbo when GPT-4 fails
- Verify graceful degradation when OpenAI quota is exceeded
- Test rate limiting behavior
- Check caching to reduce API calls

Scenarios to Test:
- Generate content rapidly to trigger rate limits
- Check console logs for fallback model usage
- Verify cached content is used when appropriate
- Test with invalid OpenAI API key (if possible)

Expected Results:
‚úÖ Graceful fallback to secondary models
‚úÖ Clear error messages for quota/rate limit issues
‚úÖ Caching reduces redundant API calls
‚úÖ System remains functional during API issues
```

**10. Trending Product Categorization Fallbacks**
```
Test scraper resilience:
- Check scraper status page (/scraper-status or similar)
- Verify AI-generated trending products when scraping fails
- Test with different niches to ensure fallbacks work universally
- Check that fallback data is clearly marked as AI-generated

Monitor in Console:
- Look for "AI Fallback" status messages
- Check that scrapers fall back to OpenAI when real data fails
- Verify mixed real + AI data scenarios

Expected Results:
‚úÖ System works even when all scrapers fail
‚úÖ AI-generated data is clearly marked
‚úÖ Fallback data is relevant to selected niche
‚úÖ No broken states when external APIs fail
```
