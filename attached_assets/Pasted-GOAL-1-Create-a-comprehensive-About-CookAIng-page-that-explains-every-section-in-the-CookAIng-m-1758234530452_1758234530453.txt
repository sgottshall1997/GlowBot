GOAL
1) Create a comprehensive **About CookAIng** page that explains every section in the CookAIng mode and how the parts fit together.
2) Append a detailed **Instruction Footer** component to the bottom of EVERY CookAIng page that states:
   - What this page is
   - How to set it up (pre-reqs, env keys, integrations, data needed)
   - How to use it (step-by-step, links to related pages)
   The audience is the owner (Spence), so include practical, explicit steps.

Before implementing, review all provided page descriptions, setup steps, and usage instructions against the existing CookAIng Marketing Engine code and confirm accuracy; if any section differs from the actual implementation, adjust the text so the About page and footers reflect the real behavior of the app.

SCOPE / GUARDRAILS
- ADDITIVE ONLY; do not refactor or remove existing code.
- All client code lives under: /src/cookaing-marketing/**
- All new pages should be routed under /cookaing-marketing/*
- Respect feature flags (ENABLE_EMAIL, ENABLE_SOCIAL, ENABLE_BLOG, ENABLE_PUSH, ENABLE_DIGEST, ENABLE_TRENDS). If a feature is disabled, the footer should note it.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
A) SHARED COMPONENT — Instruction Footer
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
1) Create component: /src/cookaing-marketing/components/InstructionFooter.tsx
   - Props:
     {
       title: string,                 // short name of the current page
       whatIsIt: string,              // 1–2 paragraph description
       setupSteps: string[],          // bullet list of concrete setup steps
       usageSteps: string[],          // bullet list of how to use it
       relatedLinks?: Array<{label:string;href:string}>, // optional links to other CookAIng pages
       envKeys?: string[],            // env vars referenced by this page (if any)
       notes?: string[]               // optional caveats / tips
     }
   - Render style:
     * shadcn/ui Card or Section at the very bottom with small “About this page” header.
     * Display “What this is”, “Setup”, “How to use”, “Related”, “Env keys”, “Notes”.
     * If feature flag for this page is disabled, show subtle warning text: “This feature is disabled by flag …”.
   - Export as default and ready for reuse.

2) Add a tiny helper: /src/cookaing-marketing/utils/featureFlags.ts
   - export functions to read ENABLE_* flags from window.__env or import.meta.env and return booleans.
   - The footer can optionally receive a note when a flag is off.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
B) ABOUT PAGE — Explains every section
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
3) Create /src/cookaing-marketing/pages/about/AboutCookAIng.tsx
   - Route: /cookaing-marketing/about
   - Content:
     * Title: “About CookAIng Marketing Engine”
     * One-paragraph overview (self-hosted CRM + automation for CookAIng).
     * A grid or accordion listing EVERY CookAIng page with 3 bullets each:
       - What it does
       - Setup (if any)
       - Typical usage flow
     * Include a “System Map” diagram (simple ASCII/markdown or bullet list) showing flows:
       Ads/Social → Forms → Contacts/Segments → Campaigns/Workflows → Email/Social/Blog/Push → Analytics/Reports → A/B/Personalization → ROAS/Attribution
     * Add InstructionFooter at the bottom specific to the About page (what, setup, how to use).

4) Add sidebar link:
   - In the CookAIng sidebar group, insert “About” → /cookaing-marketing/about (place at the top or just under Marketing Dashboard).

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
C) ATTACH FOOTER TO EVERY PAGE
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
5) For the following existing pages, import and render <InstructionFooter /> LAST in the page (beneath main content):
   - Marketing Dashboard              → /cookaing-marketing
   - Organizations                    → /cookaing-marketing/organizations

E) ROUTING & SIDEBAR
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
8) Add new sidebar item “About” in the CookAIng section.
9) Ensure every page imports and renders the InstructionFooter with the correct payload.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
F) TESTS / ACCEPTANCE
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
10) Vitest:
    - InstructionFooter renders all sections (what/setup/use/links/env/notes).
    - Each page includes the footer without runtime errors.

11) Playwright (mock env):
    - Navigate to every CookAIng route; confirm footer appears with content.
    - About page lists all sections and links navigate correctly.

ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA
- /cookaing-marketing/about exists and documents the entire system.
- Every CookAIng page shows a detailed InstructionFooter at the bottom.
- Content renders in mock mode (no external keys) with no crashes.
- Docs remain unchanged except for links to the About page if desired.
