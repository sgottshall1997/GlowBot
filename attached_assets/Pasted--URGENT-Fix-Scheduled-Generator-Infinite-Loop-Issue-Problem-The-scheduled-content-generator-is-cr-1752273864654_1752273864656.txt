URGENT: Fix Scheduled Generator Infinite Loop Issue

Problem: The scheduled content generator is creating multiple duplicate cron jobs that run simultaneously, causing repeated content generation. Each time a scheduled job is updated or restarted, a new cron task is created without properly cleaning up the old one.

Root Causes:

activeCronJobs.set(job.id, task) overwrites the Map entry but doesn't stop the previous cron task
Multiple cron jobs can exist for the same scheduled job ID
Server restart initializes all active jobs without checking if they're already running
No proper cleanup mechanism for stopping all cron jobs
Required Fixes:

Fix startCronJob function in server/api/scheduled-bulk-generation.ts:

ALWAYS stop existing cron job before creating new one
Properly destroy the old cron task
Add logging to track cron job lifecycle
Fix updateScheduledJob function:

Ensure old cron job is completely stopped before creating new one
Add validation to prevent duplicate cron jobs
Add emergency stop mechanism:

Create function to stop ALL active cron jobs immediately
Add API endpoint to emergency stop all scheduled generation
Add startup cleanup to prevent duplicate jobs
Enhance cron job management:

Add unique identifiers for each cron task
Implement proper lifecycle management
Add monitoring for active cron jobs count
Add safeguards:

Prevent starting new cron job if one already exists for that job ID
Add maximum concurrent cron jobs limit
Add automatic cleanup on server shutdown
Expected Outcome:

Only ONE cron job should exist per scheduled job entry
Stopping/updating a scheduled job should completely remove the old cron task
Server restart should not create duplicate cron jobs
Emergency stop functionality to immediately halt all scheduled generation
Test Requirements:

Verify only one cron job exists per scheduled job after restart
Test that updating a scheduled job stops the old cron completely
Confirm emergency stop works to halt all generation immediately
Validate no zombie cron processes remain after stopping jobs
Please implement these fixes with proper error handling and comprehensive logging to track the cron job lifecycle.
