Upgrade the Viral Inspiration block to use real Perplexity data instead of mock templates.

🔧 What to change:

1. Remove all sample/template-based logic from the viralInspo block
   - Do not randomly generate or hardcode inspiration
   - Do not reuse info from trending product data
   - Instead, connect this to a real Perplexity API call

📦 2. Create a utility file `fetchViralVideoInspo.ts`
   - Export an async function: fetchViralVideoInspo(productName: string, niche: string)
   - This should call Perplexity with the following prompt:

   Prompt:
   """
   You are a viral trend analyst. Find 1 real TikTok or Instagram video that went viral recently for a product like "[productName]" in the [niche] niche.

   Return JSON only:
   {
     "hook": "text used at the start of the video",
     "format": "e.g. Voiceover demo, On-screen captions, etc.",
     "caption": "the video’s original caption",
     "hashtags": ["#tag1", "#tag2", "#tag3"]
   }

   Only return real, plausible video structures. No placeholders or templates.
   """

   - Use model: `sonar-pro`
   - Temperature: 0.04
   - Search domains: ["tiktok.com", "instagram.com"]
   - Recency: "week"

⚙️ 3. Auto-trigger this fetch on product selection

When a user selects a product (either via "Use Product" or manual entry):
- Call `fetchViralVideoInspo(product.name, product.niche)`
- Store result in state variable: `viralInspo`
- Display it inside the existing “🎯 Viral Inspiration” UI block

---

📋 4. Validation + Fallback

- If the Perplexity response fails or returns malformed JSON:
  - Retry once with a fallback query (less strict)
  - Otherwise, show a friendly error or empty state

Example fallback text: “No recent viral examples found — try refreshing or selecting another product.”

---

🎯 Final Outcome:
- Viral Inspiration block now shows **real**, product-specific hooks, formats, captions, and hashtags
- This makes each piece of generated content feel tailored to what’s currently trending on social
