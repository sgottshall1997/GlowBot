✅ The manual UI safeguard fix looks great — thank you.

Now I’d like to take the next step:

🎯 GOAL:
Please re-enable support for:
1. ✅ **Scheduled content generation**
2. ✅ **Automated bulk generator**
3. ✅ **Programmatic/automated generation workflows** (e.g. from Make.com or internal scheduler)

This includes allowing non-manual triggers when they are:
- ✅ From the bulk generator
- ✅ From approved scheduling modules
- ✅ From trusted internal automation systems

---

🔧 WHAT TO DO:

1. 🔓 **Update `detectGenerationContext()` Safeguards**
   - Add a new **approvedSources list** that includes:
     ```ts
     ["manual", "bulk-scheduler", "automated-generator"]
     ```
   - Modify the safeguard logic to:
     - Allow if `mode` or `x-generation-source` is one of these
     - Continue blocking unknown/unauthorized sources

2. ✅ **Allow Bulk + Scheduled Generation**
   - Re-enable the bulk generator and scheduler modules
   - Make sure their requests are sent with `x-generation-source: bulk-scheduler` or `automated-generator`
   - Ensure these sources are whitelisted in the safeguard check

3. 🔁 **Ensure the system supports all 3 generation modes:**
   - ✅ **Manual UI generation** → Source: `"manual"` → Allowed ✅
   - ✅ **Bulk automated generator** → Source: `"automated-generator"` → Allowed ✅
   - ✅ **Scheduled generation (5AM or user-set)** → Source: `"bulk-scheduler"` → Allowed ✅

🧪 TESTING INSTRUCTIONS:

Please run and validate the following:

- 🔹 **Test A: Manual Generator**
  - Trigger content from the UI
  - ✅ Should pass

- 🔹 **Test B: Bulk Automated Generator**
  - Run the multi-niche generator via internal trigger
  - ✅ Should generate 1 per niche without 403 errors

- 🔹 **Test C: Scheduler**
  - Simulate a scheduled 5:00 AM generation run
  - ✅ Confirm content is generated and safeguard passes

Log each test's result, source, and pass/fail status.

---

✅ FINAL DELIVERABLE:
- Confirm the new trusted sources are added
- Confirm all 3 generator types are working
- Ensure production remains locked to trusted inputs only
- Return example logs showing each allowed source and generation result

I want to go live with fully controlled automation. Please ensure all logic is secure but flexible.
