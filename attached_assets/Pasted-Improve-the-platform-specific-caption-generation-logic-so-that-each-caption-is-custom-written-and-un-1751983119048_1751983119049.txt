Improve the platform-specific caption generation logic so that each caption is custom-written and uniquely tailored to the specific platform's tone, audience, and engagement style.

Implementation details:

1. In the content generation backend (used for both single and bulk generation):
   - Ensure the OpenAI prompt explicitly instructs the model to write captions **independently** from the main content output.
   - Do not simply summarize or re-use the full content. Each platform caption must be **original and tailored**.

2. For each platform, apply the following distinct styles:
   - **TikTok**:
     - Prioritize hooks, slang, emojis, and short sentences.
     - Encourage trends, humor, or urgency.
     - Example: “✨ TikTok made me buy it — again. #acnehack”
   
   - **Instagram**:
     - More aesthetic, lifestyle-driven language.
     - Focus on visuals, routines, or relatability.
     - Include clean CTA and light emoji use.
     - Example: “Your new skincare shelf essential. ✨ #skincaregoals”

   - **YouTube Shorts**:
     - Slightly longer, informative tone.
     - Should sound like a voiceover or quick script snippet.
     - Example: “This patch pulls the gunk out *overnight*. Let me show you why it’s viral.”

   - **X (Twitter)**:
     - Short, punchy, clever.
     - Lean into hot takes, jokes, or bold claims.
     - Example: “Amazon has no business selling skincare this good for $11.”

3. Make sure the `promptFactory()` now includes platform-specific instructions inside the prompt template, not just one generic prompt reused across all.

4. Validate that the output captions vary significantly from the full product description content and from each other.

5. Bonus: Add a short internal similarity check (optional) to warn if caption text overlaps more than 70% with the generated content. You can skip this if not easily implementable, but keep the logic separate if added later.

This update ensures each caption maximizes engagement by matching platform-specific tone and style.
