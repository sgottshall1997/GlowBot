I need you to thoroughly test the unified content generation system to verify it's working correctly. Please test and report on the following:
**CRITICAL TEST 1: Main Content vs Platform Caption Separation**
Generate content for "Echo Dot 5th Generation Smart Speaker" in tech niche and verify:
- ONE main video script is generated (the primary content)
- SEPARATE platform captions are generated for TikTok, Instagram, YouTube, Twitter, Facebook
- Each platform caption is DIFFERENT from the main script and from each other
- No "[TRUNCATED]" text appears anywhere in the output
- Platform captions are truly platform-native (not just reformatted main content)
**CRITICAL TEST 2: Content Display Verification**
Check the UI displays:
- Main script in its own clearly labeled section
- Each platform caption in separate, distinct sections with platform labels
- Individual copy buttons for main script AND each platform caption
- All content is complete and properly formatted
**CRITICAL TEST 3: Content Generation Flow**
Test these files work together correctly:
- `server/services/unifiedContentGenerator.ts` - Main orchestrator
- `server/services/platformContentGenerator.ts` - Platform caption generator
- `server/api/generateContentUnified.ts` - API endpoint
- `client/src/components/UnifiedContentGenerator.tsx` - UI component
- `client/src/components/GeneratedContentCard.tsx` - Content display
**CRITICAL TEST 4: Platform-Specific Quality Check**
Verify each platform caption has:
- TikTok: Gen Z language, viral hooks, trending elements
- Instagram: Aesthetic, lifestyle-focused, hashtag-heavy
- YouTube: Descriptive, SEO-friendly, longer format
- Twitter: Concise, witty, under 280 characters
- Facebook: Professional, family-friendly, community-focused
**CRITICAL TEST 5: Data Flow Validation**
Test the complete flow:
1. User selects product and platforms
2. System generates main content + platform captions
3. Content is properly stored in database
4. UI displays all pieces correctly
5. Copy buttons work for each individual piece
6. Webhook sends complete data to Make.com
**POTENTIAL ISSUES TO CHECK:**
1. **Content Extraction**: In `generateContentUnified.ts` line ~200, verify Claude response structure is properly handled:
let extractedContent = null;
if (aiResponse.content?.content) {
extractedContent = aiResponse.content.content; // Claude structure
}

2. **Platform Caption Uniqueness**: In `platformContentGenerator.ts`, verify the uniqueness enforcement is working and not generating similar content.
3. **UI Display**: In `GeneratedContentCard.tsx`, check if platform captions are displayed separately from main content with proper labels.
4. **Truncation Issues**: Search for any remaining "[TRUNCATED]" text in generated content.
5. **Database Storage**: Verify content is properly saved with both main script and platform captions.
**TEST COMMAND:**
Run this test and provide detailed output showing:
- The main script content (first 200 characters)
- Each platform caption (first 100 characters each)
- Confirmation that all content is unique and platform-optimized
- Any errors or issues found
**IF YOU FIND ISSUES:**
Report exactly what's broken and which files need fixes. The system should generate ONE main script + SEPARATE platform captions that are genuinely different and optimized for each platform.
