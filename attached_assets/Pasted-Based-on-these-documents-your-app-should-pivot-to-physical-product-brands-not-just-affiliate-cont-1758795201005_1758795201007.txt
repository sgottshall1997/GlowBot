Based on these documents, your app should pivot to physical product brands - not just affiliate content automation.
The Real Opportunity You're Missing:
All three documents emphasize the same model:

Physical consumable products with 20-40% operating margins
Subscription/repeat purchase behavior
Quick demand validation before manufacturing
AI tools replacing expensive agency work

Your GlowBot currently optimizes for: Affiliate commissions (1-10% Amazon rates)
But these documents show: Branded products (20-40% margins, recurring revenue)
What This Means for Your App:
Stop positioning GlowBot as just an affiliate content tool. Expand it to:
1. Product Idea Validation Module

Use your Perplexity integration to identify gaps (like "press-on nails trending + salon costs rising")
Analyze demand signals (search volume, Reddit complaints, TikTok pain points)
Estimate TAM (Total Addressable Market) before the user invests a dollar

2. Pre-Launch Demand Testing
The laundry detergent doc says: "Run $500 TikTok ads to landing page before manufacturing"

Your bulk generator creates multiple ad variations
Track email signups/waitlist conversions
If <100 signups at $5 CPA â†’ product fails, user saved $10k+ in manufacturing costs

3. Brand Content at Scale
Once demand is validated, your existing system creates:

Launch content (product demos, testimonials, unboxing)
Educational content (why GABA works, nail care tips)
Lifestyle content (luxury laundry rituals)

But now it's owned brand content, not affiliate spam that gets banned.
Why This Changes Everything:
Current model: User makes 3-5% affiliate commissions, gets accounts banned, repeats
New model: User validates $1M product idea for $500, then your app creates all launch content
The press-on nails example is perfect:

$5 manufacturing cost
$25 retail price
Your app creates the TikTok content showing application tutorials, durability tests, style comparisons
User owns the margin, not fighting for Amazon's 4% scraps
