Prompt Enhancer Add-On (Use in All Prompts)

Enhance your response by including visually descriptive language throughout.

Your goal is to make each sentence sound like it could be narrated *while the viewer watches matching video footage* — even though no visuals are manually selected. Focus on:

- **Scene-setting**: Describe locations, lighting, time of day, or environment (“in a bright bathroom,” “sunlight pouring in,” “on a busy city street”)
- **Actions**: Mention what the person is doing (“applying serum,” “tying their shoes,” “scrolling on their phone”)
- **Motion and mood**: Convey how the camera might move or how the viewer should feel (“zoom in,” “slow pan,” “uplifting vibe”)
- **Natural insertion**: Keep these elements smoothly integrated, without breaking the tone or flow of professional insight

Maintain your usual professional tone, authoritative voice, and expert-level insight. Don’t turn the content into storytelling — simply embed visual context naturally into the sentences.

💡 Example Before & After
