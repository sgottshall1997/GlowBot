You are GlowBot2’s Frontend Enhancement Agent.

Your mission is to redesign the current Trending Products interface to perfectly follow the BowTiedBull (BTB) framework outlined in "Automated Business Ideas in Under 10 Minutes."

---

🔁 Replace the existing layout with a new page or tab called `/trending-ai-picks`. Do not delete the original trending section, but this should become the new default.

### 🎯 Purpose:
Display high-potential affiliate products sourced via Perplexity and GPT in a clean, powerful, user-friendly grid. Each card should be optimized for scanning and quick action.

---

### ✅ New Page Requirements

1. Create a new route: `/trending-ai-picks`
2. Pull trending product data from the existing database, including:
   - productName
   - benefit
   - viralMetric
   - niche
   - source (GPT or Perplexity)
   - priceRange
   - affiliateReason
   - created_at

3. Group the page structure as follows:

#### 🔲 TOP CONTROLS:
- Dropdown: `[Select Niche]` — pulls unique values from the `niche` column
- Toggle buttons: `[All | GPT | Perplexity]` — filters by `source`
- Sort menu: `[Most Viral | Newest | Price Low to High]`

#### 📦 PRODUCT CARD DESIGN (Use Responsive Grid)
Each product card should contain:

┌────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ 🔥 [productName] [GPT/Perplexity badge]
│ 💡 “[benefit]”
│ 📈 Viral Metric: [viralMetric]
│ 💰 Price: [priceRange] · 🏷️ [Amazon or source]
│ ✨ Why it's hot: [affiliateReason]
│
│ [ Generate Content ] [ View Product (optional) ]
└────────────────────────────────────────────┘

4. Add logic to:
   - Display only products matching the filters
   - Sort properly by selected value (e.g., viralMetric as number if possible)
   - Render all cards responsively (3–4 per row desktop, 1–2 on mobile)

### ✨ UX Enhancements:

- Use Tailwind or Chakra (depending on stack) to apply visual polish:
  - `🔥`, `💡`, `📈`, `💰`, `✨` for iconographic clarity
  - Rounded cards, shadow, padding
  - Highlight top 1–2 cards per niche with a subtle gold border or "Top Pick" badge
- GPT vs Perplexity should be visible on each card
- Make the "Generate Content" button send the product directly into the content generator pipeline
- (Optional) Add a “Star” or “Favorite” button to mark top ideas

---

### 🔒 Tech Constraints

- Use existing backend structure. Do not rewrite DB.
- Use `source` field (`gpt`, `perplexity`) to enable filtering
- Add fallback text if no products match the filter
- Allow this tab to refresh daily using 5 AM cron if tied to the Perplexity product puller
