🛑 Problem:
I ran the automated bulk content generator using the scheduler for all 7 niches — but the output included duplicate and unrelated products. Specifically, I got multiple versions of:

- "Niacinamide 10% + Zinc 1% Serum 1oz"
- A single Echo Dot
- A single yoga pants product

Only 3 unique products appeared — and 5+ rows were duplicates of the same skincare item. No niche diversity.

🎯 Goal:
Fix the automated bulk generator so that it:
- ✅ Generates **exactly 1 unique product per niche**
- ✅ Matches each product to the correct niche (beauty, fitness, tech, pets, fashion, travel, food/kitchen)
- ✅ Avoids product duplication within the same run
- ✅ Stores the correct product data to the content history, Make webhook, and evaluation system

🔧 Required Fixes:

1. ✅ **Ensure Niche-Based Looping**
   - The bulk generator should iterate through the official 7-niche list:
     ```ts
     ["beauty", "fitness", "technology", "pets", "fashion", "travel", "food"]
     ```
   - For each, it should trigger generation independently and clearly pass the `niche` to the backend

2. ✅ **Fix Product Selection Logic**
   - Validate that each content generation call is retrieving a trending or relevant product *for that specific niche*
   - If using a trend-fetching API or DB, ensure it queries using the `niche` filter and doesn’t default to beauty/skincare
   - Add a fallback strategy for niche-product mapping if trending data is unavailable

3. 🔁 **Add Deduplication Logic**
   - Within a single run, do not allow duplicate products across multiple niche generations
   - If a product is reused by multiple niches, pick a new one or randomize alternatives

4. ✅ **Run Automated Tests**
   - Simulate a scheduled bulk generation run
   - Confirm 7 rows are created with:
     - Unique products
     - Distinct `niche` tags
     - Model and format recorded
     - Script generated and passed through evaluation

   - Check:
     - Output in Google Sheet or DB
     - Make webhook payloads
     - `contentHistory` records

🧪 Final Validation Checklist:
- [ ] 7 total content items generated
- [ ] No duplicate products
- [ ] Each item clearly assigned to one of the 7 niches
- [ ] Script + rating + product match stored
- [ ] No 403s or errors during generation

- What caused the wrong product duplication
- How you fixed niche mapping and product selection
- A sample of the new test run (product + niche + caption)

The goal is to have a **reliable, automated bulk generator that always produces 7 distinct, niche-aligned items**. Please ensure it works before confirming it's ready.
