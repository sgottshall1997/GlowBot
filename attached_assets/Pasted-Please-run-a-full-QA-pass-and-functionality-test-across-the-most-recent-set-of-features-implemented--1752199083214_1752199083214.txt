Please run a full QA pass and functionality test across the most recent set of features implemented in the GlowBot app. These include UI, backend logic, and scheduled automation. Test each of the following:

---

🔥 **1. Unified Generator:**
- Ensure both single product generation and automated bulk generation are working via the unified endpoint.
- Check for prompt routing, correct tone/template/platform handling.
- Validate that content and captions are output in expected format.

🧠 **2. Model Selector (Claude vs GPT):**
- Ensure the model selector dropdown is visible in:
  - Single product generator
  - Automated bulk generator
  - Scheduled automation config
- Test both Claude and GPT options for generation and confirm they produce output without error.
- GPT should be selected by default and function as fallback.

🔁 **3. Model Persistence Across Modes:**
- Validate that selected model is retained across:
  - Manual single generation session
  - Bulk generation session
  - Scheduled task execution
- Model selection should be respected at runtime and properly logged.

📆 **4. Trending AI Picks Page – Date Sorting:**
- Verify a new "Date Pulled" field is displayed for all Perplexity products.
- Test sorting options: `Newest`, `Mentions`, `Date Pulled` to ensure sorting is correct.
- Confirm no regressions on existing sort behavior.

📂 **5. Trending Picks Organized by Niche:**
- Ensure picks are grouped clearly by niche (e.g., beauty, food, fashion).
- Section headings should be visually clear and collapsible (if implemented).
- Confirm that "Generate Content" and "View Product" work inside each section.

📅 **6. Scheduled Automation System:**
- Confirm that scheduled jobs allow setting of all critical inputs:
  - Niche
  - Template
  - Tone
  - Target platforms
  - Claude vs GPT model
- Ensure jobs execute correctly at scheduled times and pull the right model + prompt
- Output must be identical to what would be generated manually with same settings

---

🧪 **Additional QA:**
- Validate console logs or API logs are capturing which model was used
- Confirm no console errors
- Ensure UI is responsive on mobile and tablet

After running these tests, please confirm that:
- Everything works as expected
- Nothing broke in previous logic
- Any regressions are identified and logged

Make sure this system is production-ready and user-proof.
