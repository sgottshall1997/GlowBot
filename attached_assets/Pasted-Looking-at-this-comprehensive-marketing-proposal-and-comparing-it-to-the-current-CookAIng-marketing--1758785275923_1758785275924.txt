üéØ Summary
The current CookAIng tools are excellent for analytics, reporting, and campaign optimization but have significant gaps in:

Social media management (0% coverage)
CRM functionality (10% coverage)
Marketing automation (20% coverage)
Customer support (0% coverage)
Content management (30% coverage)
The tools are more focused on data analysis and optimization rather than execution and management of marketing activities. They're perfect for monitoring and improving campaigns but don't handle the day-to-day operational aspects of digital marketing.

To fully match the proposal's scope, CookAIng would need additional modules for social media management, CRM, automation, and customer support - essentially expanding from a "monitoring and optimization" platform to a "full-service marketing operations" platform.
