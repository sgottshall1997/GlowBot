---

## 🔥 PHASE 1: Lock in the BTB Core Flywheel (You're \~85% Done)

### ✅ 1. Daily Trend-Based Generation (COMPLETE / TUNING)

* [x] 7 niches: skincare, fitness, tech, fashion, cooking, travel, pets
* [x] Trending product scraping (Amazon + fallback)
* [x] PromptFactory creates optimized GPT payloads
* [x] Webhook sends payloads to Make.com

**→ To polish:**

* [ ] Add influencer-specific angles in prompt (e.g., "A personal trainer explains...")
* [ ] Ensure trend data is cached and rotates only 1x/day (5 AM cron ✅)

---

### ✅ 2. Content Structuring & Distribution

* [x] Scripts + captions structured into JSON
* [x] Uploaded to Google Docs via Make.com
* [x] Scripts ready for Pictory import

**→ To finish:**

* [ ] Autoname Google Docs using `[niche] – [product]`
* [ ] Add platform checkboxes in frontend (Instagram, TikTok, Twitter, etc.)
* [ ] Generate post format specific to each (video + caption vs tweet vs blog)

---

### ✅ 3. Affiliate-Ready Redirect Links

* [x] Amazon product links in payload
* [ ] Smart redirect link generator (e.g., `/go/[slug]`)
* [ ] Track click count, source platform, timestamp → store in SQLite

---

## ⚙️ PHASE 2: Add Traffic & Monetization Layer

### 🟨 4. Automated Cross-Posting

* [ ] Make.com scenario posts to Instagram, TikTok, Twitter
* [ ] Use platform-specific formatting (e.g., video script/caption vs tweet text)

### 🟨 5. Content Performance Feedback Loop

* [ ] Input post metadata (views, likes, comments, purchases)
* [ ] AI Score + Quality Analysis fields added to SQLite
* [ ] Use this to identify top-performers and refine future prompts

---

## 🧠 PHASE 3: Full Agent Mode (Future-Proofing)

### 🟪 6. Self-Iterating Agent (Optional but Powerful)

* [ ] Agent auto-creates test scripts using new viral formats
* [ ] Scores outputs using GPT
* [ ] Saves and reuses best-performing hooks

---

## 💸 PHASE 4: Monetization + Scaling

### 🟦 7. Expand Affiliate Networks

* [ ] Apply for ShareASale, CJ, LTK, or niche skincare programs
* [ ] Add “Affiliate Provider” field to payload

### 🟦 8. Add Paid Content Option

* [ ] Generate email list (use lead magnet like "Top 10 Beauty Hacks from Viral Creators")
* [ ] Email weekly bundles of content or early access to trending picks
