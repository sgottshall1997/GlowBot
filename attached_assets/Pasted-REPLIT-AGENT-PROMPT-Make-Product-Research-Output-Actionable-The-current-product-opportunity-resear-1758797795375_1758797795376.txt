REPLIT AGENT PROMPT: Make Product Research Output Actionable

The current product opportunity research returns generic, useless summaries. 
Transform it to provide decision-making data that actually helps validate 
whether to test a product idea.

CURRENT PROBLEM:
Output says "Market analysis shows potential based on current trends and 
consumer demands. Further research recommended to validate specific 
opportunities."

This is worthless. It could apply to any product in any category.

NEW REQUIREMENTS FOR RESEARCH OUTPUT:

For each product opportunity found, the system MUST return:

1. SPECIFIC PRODUCT IDEA
   - Exact product description (not "beauty devices" but "LED red light 
     therapy wand for at-home face treatments")
   - Why this specific product, not just the category

2. PROOF OF DEMAND
   - Monthly search volume for this exact product type
   - Number of TikTok videos in past 30 days with [product] hashtag
   - Reddit mentions/complaints about this problem in past 90 days
   - Concrete numbers, not "shows potential"

3. COMPETITION ANALYSIS
   - Name 3-5 existing brands selling this product
   - Their approximate price points
   - Market saturation level: LOW/MEDIUM/HIGH with reasoning

4. MARGIN POTENTIAL
   - Estimated manufacturing cost (source: Alibaba rough estimate)
   - Typical retail price based on competitor research  
   - Calculated margin: X% gross margin
   - Example: "$8 cost ‚Üí $35 retail = 77% gross margin"

5. TARGET CUSTOMER
   - Specific demographic (not "women 25-45" but "working moms 30-40 
     in major metros who follow clean beauty influencers")
   - Their specific pain point this solves
   - Where they spend time online (TikTok/Instagram/Pinterest/etc)

6. VALIDATION DIFFICULTY
   - Easy/Medium/Hard to test with $500 ad budget
   - Reasoning: visual appeal, impulse buy price point, content creation ease
   - Red flags if any (high returns, customer education required, etc)

7. SUCCESSFUL EXAMPLES
   - Name 1-2 brands that went viral with this product type
   - What made their content work (specific hooks/formats)
   - Links to their top performing content if available

8. GO/NO-GO INDICATORS
   Clear checklist format:
   ‚úÖ Search volume >10k/month
   ‚úÖ Margins >40%
   ‚ùå High competition (20+ established brands)
   ‚úÖ Visual product (good for TikTok)
   
TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION:

Update the Perplexity query in /server/api/product-research.ts to request 
this specific data structure. The prompt to Perplexity should be:

"For the [category] category, identify 3 specific product opportunities. 
For each provide:
- Exact product with specific features
- Monthly search volume and social media mention count  
- 3 competitor brand names with price points
- Manufacturing cost estimate and typical retail price
- Specific target customer demo and pain point
- Test difficulty rating with reasoning
- Example of successful brand in this space
Return data in structured format with concrete numbers, not vague potential."

Update ProductOpportunity type definition to include all these fields.

Update the UI card display to show this data in scannable format with:
- Traffic light indicator (üü¢ Low competition, üü° Medium, üî¥ High)
- Margin calculation prominently displayed
- Clear "Worth Testing" vs "Skip" recommendation based on data

The output should let me look at it for 30 seconds and know: 
"Yes, I'm testing this with $500" or "No, moving on."

No more generic bullshit. Every field must have a specific data point or 
it should say "Data not available" rather than faking it with vague language.
