Objective:
Ensure each platform-specific caption (TikTok, Instagram, YouTube, X) is distinct from the main generated content and uniquely suited to the platform’s tone and audience.

Implementation:

1. Update `platformContentGenerator.ts` inside the `generatePlatformCaptions()` function:
   - Explicitly instruct the OpenAI prompt to avoid repeating or closely paraphrasing the main generated content.
   - For each platform, inject a unique tone, structure, and engagement style.

2. Inject platform-specific prompt logic like the following:

   ```ts
   const platformPrompts = {
     tiktok: `Write a short, punchy TikTok caption for the product "${productName}". Use slang, emojis, and Gen Z tone. Do NOT reuse or reword the main product description. Add a strong hook and CTA.`,
     instagram: `Write a polished, aesthetic Instagram caption for "${productName}". Use lifestyle language, light emojis, and hashtags. DO NOT copy or paraphrase the main product description.`,
     youtube: `Write a YouTube Shorts description that sounds like a voiceover script. Aim for informative but casual tone. Include hashtags. DO NOT reuse the full content output.`,
     twitter: `Write a clever, short X (Twitter) post about "${productName}". Include a bold claim or hot take. DO NOT reuse the original content. Include 1-2 trending hashtags.`
   };
For each caption:

Check for similarity to the main content using a basic string similarity or keyword overlap check (optional but recommended).

If similarity is above 70%, re-run the prompt with a slightly higher temperature or an enforced reword.

Increase prompt temperature to 0.9 and add:

"Presence_penalty": 0.8

"Frequency_penalty": 0.5
to maximize variety.

Make sure the generatePlatformCaptions() function receives the full generated content and avoids using it as source reference.

Optional: Add a flag in the backend (enforceCaptionUniqueness: true) that lets you easily toggle this mode for testing or fallback logic.

Outcome:
All platform captions will now feel native, engaging, and intentionally distinct from the full product description — increasing credibility and reducing repetitive feel across outputs.
