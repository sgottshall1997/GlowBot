Write a direct, impactful review script for the pet product ”{{productName}}”, intended for a 30–60 second social media video about pets or pet care.

Your task is to help viewers quickly understand why {{productName}} is worth using for their pets by presenting clear, specific information about its functionality, quality, benefits, and value—while avoiding vague claims and filler.

The script must include the following sections, in order:

⸻

1. Attention-grabbing hook

Start with a surprising or slightly negative statement that includes the product name and stops the viewer from scrolling.

Use a different hook each time – do not reuse hooks.

Examples:
	•	“Still using old bowls instead of {{productName}}? Here’s what your pet is missing.”
	•	“Most pet owners skip {{productName}} — here’s why they regret it.”
	•	“Stop guessing what works — here’s why {{productName}} delivers real results.”
	•	“Is {{productName}} just another gimmick? Let’s test it.”
	•	“Think all pet gear is the same? {{productName}} proves otherwise.”
	•	“Don’t buy another toy before seeing this about {{productName}}.”

2. Specific features and pet-focused benefits

List 3–4 clear, factual benefits of the product based on its design or function.

Include details like:
	•	Pet-specific design (e.g., chew-resistant, slow-feed, ergonomic for paws)
	•	Safety or health benefits (e.g., BPA-free, vet-approved, supports digestion)
	•	Materials and durability (e.g., non-toxic silicone, stainless steel, tear-resistant fabric)
	•	Comfort or ease of use (e.g., padded straps, anti-slip base, breathable mesh)
	•	Ease of cleaning (e.g., dishwasher-safe, machine-washable)

Avoid generic claims like “great for pets.” Be precise about why and how it works.
