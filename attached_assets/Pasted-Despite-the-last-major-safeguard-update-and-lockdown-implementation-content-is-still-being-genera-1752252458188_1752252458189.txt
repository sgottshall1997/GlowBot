Despite the last major safeguard update and lockdown implementation, **content is still being generated automatically** — even though I am not triggering it manually.

Please fully investigate and eliminate whatever is still triggering these generation events.

🔍 What to do:

1. ✅ **Trace Every Entry Point**
   - Audit **every route, cron job, background worker, retry handler, webhook, and timer** that could possibly trigger `generateContent()` or any function that calls OpenAI/Claude
   - Include:
     - Past cron jobs that may still be registered
     - Retry logic (especially if stuck from a previous failure)
     - Webhooks that may be firing from external services (e.g. Make, Zapier)
     - Trend fetchers or internal “watchers” that queue generation unintentionally

2. 🔒 **Reinforce Safeguard Check**
   - Ensure `generation-safeguards.ts` is enforced at the **start** of every generation-related function
   - Log and block **any non-manual trigger**, including:
     - Background job names
     - API route
     - Trigger source (manual, cron, webhook, etc.)

3. 🧠 **Implement a Global “Generation Allowed” Flag**
   - Create a config variable like:
     ```ts
     const GENERATION_ALLOWED = process.env.GENERATION_ALLOWED || false;
     ```
   - Wrap all generation logic with:
     ```ts
     if (!GENERATION_ALLOWED) {
       log("Blocked: generation not allowed");
       return null;
     }
     ```

4. 🧪 **Run 2-Hour Monitoring Window**
   - Enable verbose logging of all generation attempts
   - Log:
     - Exact time
     - Niche/product
     - Model used
     - Trigger origin
   - Confirm **no content is generated** unless manually triggered from the UI

5. ✅ **Final Output**
   - Identify exactly *what was still running*
   - Show code/config that was changed or removed
   - Provide log proof of blocked/unblocked generation attempts
   - Confirm that the **system is now fully locked down**, and only UI-triggered generation is permitted

This is critical — please treat it as a top priority fix.
