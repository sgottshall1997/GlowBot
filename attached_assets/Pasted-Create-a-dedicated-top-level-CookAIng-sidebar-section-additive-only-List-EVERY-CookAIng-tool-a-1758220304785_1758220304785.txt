Create a dedicated top-level “CookAIng” sidebar section (additive-only). 
List EVERY CookAIng tool as individual links. Keep all routes under /cookaing-marketing/*.
If a page doesn’t exist yet, scaffold a minimal, non-breaking page with shadcn/ui.

ROUTING & PAGES
- For each path above, ensure a route and page component exists. 
- For NEW pages, scaffold with:
  * Header, description, breadcrumb.
  * Core table or form stub (no external API calls if keys missing).
  * Empty-state & skeleton loaders.
  * Safe guards so app runs with empty .env.

EXTRA DETAILS
- Experiments: show ab_tests with metrics (assignments, opens, clicks, conversions), link to Campaign detail A/B panel, “Recompute winner” action if supported.
- Costs & ROAS: file uploader (schema: date,campaign_platform,campaign_name,cost), list of imports, ROAS summary by campaign & channel.
- Attribution Inspector: grid with filters (campaign, source/medium), show per-contact first_touch/last_touch + UTMs; link to the Contact.
- Webhooks Monitor: paginated event table (source, event, campaignId, processed status, timestamp); retry action for failed parses (mock-safe).
- Email Delivery Test: pick any campaign artifact → render HTML preview; dry-run “mock send” writes to a local outbox table/log.
- Developer Tools: seed script trigger, e2e smoke button (runs minimal checks), feature flags (ENABLE_EMAIL, ENABLE_SOCIAL, ENABLE_BLOG, ENABLE_PUSH, ENABLE_DIGEST, ENABLE_TRENDS) toggles persisted in app config/storage.

DOCS UPDATE
- On /cookaing-marketing/docs, add a “Site Map” listing every sidebar item with a 1–2 line description and links to required env keys (if any). 
- Note which pages operate in mock mode with empty .env.

ACCEPTANCE
- New top-level “CookAIng” section appears with ALL links above.
- Each link navigates to a working page (existing or scaffolded) without API keys.
- No regressions to existing routes. 
- Docs page includes a full site map and env/mode notes.
