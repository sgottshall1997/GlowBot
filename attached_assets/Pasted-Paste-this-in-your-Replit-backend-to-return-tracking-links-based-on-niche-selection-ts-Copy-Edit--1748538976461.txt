Absolutely ‚Äî here‚Äôs a fully written Replit prompt you can paste into your GPT Assistant or Replit AI to describe exactly what you want built:

üß† Replit Prompt: Dropdown Niche Selector with Amazon Affiliate Links
I want to build an Express route + frontend dropdown that allows a user to select a niche (e.g., skincare, tech, fashion, etc.), and then displays pre-set Amazon affiliate products with my tracking ID (sgottshall199-20). Each niche should have 1 example product with a description and valid affiliate link.

‚úÖ Backend Requirements:
Create an Express route /amazon-links that:

Accepts a niche query param (e.g., ?niche=fitness)

Returns a JSON response containing:

The product name

The Amazon affiliate URL

Use this object as the data source:

  travel: [
    { product: "Packing Cubes Set", url: "https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01E7AVSKG?tag=sgottshall199-20" },

  pets: [
    { product: "Chik 'n Hide Twists", url: "https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01CPJ38RY?tag=sgottshall199-20" },
  ]
};
‚úÖ Frontend Requirements:
Add a dropdown with the following options:

Skincare

Add a ‚ÄúCopy Link‚Äù button next to each result to easily copy the affiliate URL to clipboard.

Optional Enhancements:
Add loading + error handling

Highlight the current selection

Mobile responsive layout (TailwindCSS optional)
