You are the GlowBot2 Executive Dashboard Agent.

Redesign the `/dashboard` view to match the BowTiedBull-style automation flow from the “Automated Business Ideas in Under 10 Minutes” PDF and the screenshots provided.

---

### 🎯 OBJECTIVE:
Create a fast, simplified dashboard layout that makes it easy to:
1. Discover trending affiliate products (Perplexity-based)
2. Generate content in one click
3. See results and optimize
4. Prepare for full workflow automation (daily fetch, auto-posting, performance tracking)

---

### 🧱 STRUCTURE: SECTION-BY-SECTION

---

1️⃣ **💥 Hero Header**

```tsx
<h1 class="text-3xl font-bold">🚀 GlowBot AI: Your BTB Command Center</h1>
<p class="text-muted">Trend-to-traffic in under 10 minutes. Powered by Perplexity + GPT.</p>
Place this at the top. Keep spacing tight.

2️⃣ 🔥 AI-Powered Trending Picks (Perplexity)

Embed a grid of product cards just below the header:

Pull up to 3 products per niche

Only show items with source = perplexity

Include: product name, virality stat, 1-line “why it’s hot,” tag, and generated date

Two buttons: [Generate Content] and [View Product]

Add “Run Perplexity Fetch” button up top (right-aligned)

Each card should be colored by niche (as in your screenshot)

3️⃣ 🎯 Fast-Action Buttons Panel

Under the trending grid, create a 3-column panel like this:

tsx
Copy
Edit
<Panel>
  [🪄 Generate Content Now] – Takes user to `/generate`
  [🧩 Manage Templates] – `/templates`
  [⚡ Generate Daily Batch] – `/generate-daily`
</Panel>
Use the same color block layout shown in your screenshot. Keep CTAs short.

4️⃣ 📊 Stats Summary Strip (Inline)
Beneath the buttons, add a tight row showing:

tsx
Copy
Edit
🔥 Trending Products: 28  
🧠 Niches Active: 7  
✍️ AI Scripts Generated: 2,400 (this month)  
✅ Success Rate: 97%
Use compact Tailwind cards or flex-based grid. Pull live data if available.

5️⃣ 🧠 Daily Content Showcase
Show the latest 3 content cards with highest AI scores or GPT summary rating.

If no content today, show placeholder:

tsx
Copy
Edit
No showcase content yet today. Start by generating from a trending pick above!
6️⃣ 📦 Top Affiliate Picks by Category (Folded/Optional)
This section can stay but be collapsed by default, OR moved to a separate tab /affiliate-explorer.

If kept, label it as:

tsx
Copy
Edit
🧰 Manual Product Explorer (Legacy)
💡 FUTURE AUTOMATION PLACEMENT
Reserve space at the bottom for future BTB automation modules:

tsx
Copy
Edit
<ComingSoon label="🧠 Automation Pipeline Preview">
  Perplexity → Content → Make.com → Performance Loop
</ComingSoon>
Or eventually replace with:

 Auto-post status

 Top CTR performer of the day

 “Regenerate Underperformers” button

⚙️ TECH + LAYOUT
Reuse Perplexity card components from /trending-ai-picks

Use Tailwind for layout – max-width container, responsive grid

Replace the current “28 products / skincare dropdown” section

Remove old niche tabs and static Amazon category blocks

Link “Generate Content” to pre-fill template based on product
