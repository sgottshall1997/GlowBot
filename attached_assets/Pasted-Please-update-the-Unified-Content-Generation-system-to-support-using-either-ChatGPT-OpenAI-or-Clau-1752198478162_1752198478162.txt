Please update the Unified Content Generation system to support using either ChatGPT (OpenAI) or Claude (Anthropic) for both content and caption generation.

üß† Requirements:

1. **Model Selector UI:**
   - Add a new dropdown field labeled: `AI Model`
   - Options: `ChatGPT (default)` and `Claude`
   - This selector should appear:
     - On the manual Single Product Generator
     - On the Automated Bulk Generator setup
     - Inside the Scheduled Automation config modal

2. **Backend Logic Update:**
   - Update the backend generation function to check for which model was selected:
     - If `ChatGPT` is selected, call the existing OpenAI logic (no change)
     - If `Claude` is selected, use the Claude API integration (already installed) for both:
       - Content generation
       - Platform captions

3. **Scheduling System:**
   - Ensure the selected model is passed and stored in scheduled tasks
   - Scheduled jobs must call the correct model at runtime based on the saved selection

4. **Prompt Routing:**
   - Ensure the promptFactory() or equivalent routing logic dynamically switches prompt format and API call depending on the selected model
   - Claude may require different system/structure prompts ‚Äî include a basic conditional if needed

5. **Defaults:**
   - GPT should always be pre-selected by default
   - If no model is selected, fallback to GPT

6. **Testing & Debugging:**
   - Fully test both manual and automated generation using both models
   - Validate that the selected model is respected during:
     - Initial generation
     - Bulk runs
     - Scheduled generations
   - Add temporary console logs for `model selected: CLAUDE/GPT` in dev mode

7. **UX Note:**
   - Make sure dropdown placement is consistent with tone/template/target platform selectors
   - Use tooltips if needed to explain model choice (‚ÄúClaude may provide more verbose outputs‚Äù)

This feature should not break anything that currently works with GPT. Claude should be plug-and-play, but isolated behind a selection so it doesn‚Äôt disrupt default logic.

Please test this end-to-end and confirm functionality.
