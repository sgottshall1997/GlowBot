Thanks for the fixes and detailed report â€” this is almost there.

Now I want you to run a **final comprehensive test** to fully verify the automated bulk generator is functioning with 100% reliability, no bugs, and true production readiness.

---

ðŸŽ¯ Test Objective:
Ensure that the bulk generator:
- âœ… Produces exactly **1 unique content piece per selected niche**
- âœ… Uses only available products per niche from the DB
- âœ… Never duplicates products in a single run
- âœ… Successfully routes each output through the webhook pipeline with 200 OK
- âœ… Stores all results correctly in `contentHistory`, including evaluations and source tracking

---

ðŸ§ª Required Test Cases:

1. **Run a 7-Niche Full Test (Automated Scheduler Trigger)**
   - Confirm that each of these niches produces exactly 1 piece:
     ```
     ["beauty", "technology", "fashion", "fitness", "food", "travel", "pets"]
     ```
   - Check logs, console outputs, and DB:
     - Each product is unique
     - Each has a corresponding webhook payload with 200 response
     - No duplicate products or skipped niches

2. **Run a Manual Bulk Generation Test (Subset Mode)**
   - Try a 3-niche run (e.g. beauty, pets, tech)
   - Confirm correct subset targeting
   - Ensure webhook and contentHistory flows still work correctly

3. **Validate Internal Safeguards & Edge Cases**
   - Confirm that:
     - A niche with no products triggers a clear error or fallback (donâ€™t crash the run)
     - All product selections are **distinct and correctly tagged**
     - Any prior bugs (like caption errors or "undefined" product handling) are fully resolved

---

âœ… What to Return:

Please send a final validation report with:
- âœ… For each niche: the product used, the script generated, and confirmation of webhook delivery
- âœ… A summary of any retries, skips, or warnings triggered during generation
- âœ… Confirmation that all logic paths are working: scheduler-triggered, manual, and fallback-safe
- âœ… Screenshots or console logs confirming proper sequence ("Completed 1/7", etc.)

---

The goal is to confidently use this generator as a **daily production tool**. Please ensure everything is bulletproof and clearly documented before I go live with regular use.
