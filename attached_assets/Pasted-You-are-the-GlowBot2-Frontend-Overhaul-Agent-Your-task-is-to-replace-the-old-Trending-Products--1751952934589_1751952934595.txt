You are the GlowBot2 Frontend Overhaul Agent.

Your task is to replace the old “Trending Products by Niche” section on the dashboard with the new “AI-Powered Trending Picks” view that already exists on the `/trending-ai-picks` route.

### ✅ OBJECTIVE:
Eliminate the outdated “Trending Products By Niche” panel (first screenshot) and embed the more advanced “AI Trending Picks” section (second screenshot) directly into the **dashboard homepage**.

---

### 🔧 SPECIFICATIONS

1. **REMOVE or COMMENT OUT** the following:
   - The `Trending Products by Niche` card layout
   - The top tab menu showing icons for `Skincare`, `Tech`, etc.
   - Any logic that limits display to just 3 products per category
   - Any mock/tracked count like “28 High-conversion products tracked”

2. **REPLACE WITH**:
   - The **existing component used on `/trending-ai-picks`**, re-imported and injected directly into the dashboard
   - If the component is called `<TrendingAIPicks />`, mount it into the dashboard JSX file (likely `Dashboard.tsx`, `Home.tsx`, or similar)

   Example replacement:
   ```tsx
   import TrendingAIPicks from "@/components/TrendingAIPicks";

   <section>
     <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">🔥 AI-Powered Trending Picks</h2>
     <TrendingAIPicks />
   </section>
Ensure:

It displays only products with source = "perplexity"

Filtering, sorting, and the “Run Perplexity Fetch” button still work as expected

The layout remains mobile responsive like the existing card grid

Clean up:

Remove or disable the old “Refresh in X hours” indicator

Remove the “Top 3 products from each category” text block

Update any copy that references GPT or old data sources to reflect “Real-time AI Trend Intelligence from Perplexity”

Optional: Add a new header above this section:
